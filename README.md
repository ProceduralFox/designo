# App premise and architecture

This App is one in a collection of projects that I've built to design provided by https://www.frontendmentor.io/. I've done several of these because I believe that a design-to-code workflow is common in many companies and I've wanted to demonstrate my ability to work to an assignment. I was provided with figma files, and a desired feature description and the implementation was all on me.

I've chosen Next.js for this project because from a business perspective I think that this kind of static, company landing page, website is one of the typos to benefit the most from the SEO benefits that next offers.

There isn't much to talk about here really, it is just a simple layout component rendering a header, a footer and the actual page content itself.

# Most valuable lesson


Big files are bad. Other than this most important piece of sacred knowledge I have grown quite fond of Next.js and the versatility it offers in combining server side rendering with dynamically rendering some components on the client.
